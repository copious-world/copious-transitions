# copious-transitions

This is a web service that provides authorization logic for certain types of API pathways.

The pathways are regulate tokenized access to certain types of media, static, dynamic, and transitional. 

User pathways provide interfaces to login/logout and other possible types of user interactions that a web service might support.
The user pathways may be configured to work with application requirements by allowing for the configuration of modules requirements for modules that 
provide subclassing customizations to generalized classes which carry out commonly occuring backend interfaces. Some of the general modules may interact
with databases, crypto modules, middleware modules, file management modules, etc. Customization may allow for selections of databases, file systems, 
state management processes, etc. 

For example, several types of authorization have been addressed and interfaces to difference repositories have been addressed. Using the copious-transitions
framework, authorization such as logining in, wrapped key with accounts, and derived key with no stored accounts have been developed. There are three
terse application classes for each kind of authorization and each type of authorization descends from the same generalized authorization classes.

Similarly, file uploading has placed files on disks, encrypted or not, and has utiltized IPFS and other storage schemes. Uploading is processed in all
cases by the same transtional pathways which check session and captcha prior to allowing data transfer. And, terse customized subclasses of transition 
engines have provided choices for the type of medium onto which the uploaders place files. In each case, some custom code is required for utilizing 
types of storage and this custom code is required beyond the normalization done by file systems.

Copious-transitions applications are servers. A single web service will have a number of servers handling similar paths but different logic.
The copious-transitions package makes it easy to decide that one server may handle sessions lifecylces and that other servers will obtain shared 
session inforamtion within a local cluster. A process can be configured to include or omit user management API pathways. While all servers will include token
authorized media pathways.
